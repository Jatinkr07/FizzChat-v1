## Introduction
FizzChat is a dynamic real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.io for seamless communication. This application aims to provide users with an interactive platform for real-time messaging, supporting both group and private chats. The application also incorporates user authentication to ensure secure access to chat services.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality to protect user data.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Instant messaging powered by Socket.io, ensuring messages are delivered and displayed in real-time.
- **User Presence**: See when users are online and available to chat.
- **Chat Rooms**: Create and join chat rooms to converse with multiple users.
- **Private Messaging**: Send direct messages to other users for private conversations.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design ensuring compatibility across various devices.
  

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js: For building the user interface.
  - Tailwind CSS: For styling the application.

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js: For server-side JavaScript runtime.
  - Express.js: For building the RESTful APIs.

- **Database**: 
  - MongoDB: For storing user data and chat messages.
    
- **Real-Time Communication**: 
  - Socket.io: For real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
